# Secure, Passwordless Web Authentication with MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and React (Vite)

Hey everyone! In this video, we’ll explore how to implement secure, passwordless web authentication in your application using:

- **MongoDB**
- **Express.js**
- **Node.js**
- **React** frontend with **Vite**

We’ll dive into using **Passkeys, including Fingerprint and Face ID**, to enhance security through Web Authentication.

Let’s get started!

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to set up passwordless authentication using modern web technologies. We'll implement Passkeys for Fingerprint and Face ID authentication to ensure a secure and user-friendly login experience.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: For database management.
- **Express.js**: As the web application framework.
- **Node.js**: To run the server-side code.
- **React with Vite**: For building the frontend.

## Features

- Secure passwordless authentication
- Support for Passkeys including Fingerprint and Face ID
- Easy setup and integration with MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and React

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- MongoDB instance running
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string and any other required environment variables.

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Implementing Passkeys

We'll implement Passkeys by integrating Web Authentication APIs that allow users to log in using biometrics like Fingerprint and Face ID.

1. **Set up the backend with Node.js and Express to handle authentication requests.**
2. **Configure MongoDB for storing user credentials securely.**
3. **Build the frontend using React and Vite, implementing the Web Authentication API for biometric logins.**
